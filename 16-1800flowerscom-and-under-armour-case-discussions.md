## Discussion Questions {-}

1. Spend four hours or less writing a case report for either the 2017 or the
2018 final exam. What components of your case report came easiest/hardest to
you? Was it collecting data that might be relevant to making a decision;
identifying and stating one or two high-level concerns, problems, or issues;
identifying and evaluating alternatives; or designing an action plan? Take ten
minutes to free write about the process you engaged in. (You can keep the case
report you generate for your own records.)  
2. How could you further hone your decision-making and written communication
skills between now and the final exam period to help you reach your full
potential? Refer to page 3 of @haywood-farmer-2008 for ideas.
