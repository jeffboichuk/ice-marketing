## Discussion Question {-}

How should Allianz implement your recommendation, and how did you arrive at
these implementation choices? IIP 3 asks you to form a well-reasoned answer to
this question that spans the four elements of the marketing mix.

Rather than have separate paragraphs or sections for each of the four Ps, the
action plan you advance in your IIP 3 Client Standalone Deck Report should be
*seamless*. As is true for inter-disciplinary curriculum in business schools,
the best action plans are integrated. What does this mean practically? You
should think of the marketing mix as a framework you can use to create a
comprehensive action plan. However, it would be a mistake to let the framework
silo your thinking or the structure of your output. Again, you should *not*
separate your action plan into four paragraphs or sections, one for each element
of the marketing mix. Instead, describe how Allianz should bring your initiative
to market by weaving specifications for elements of the marketing mix into a
holistic action plan seamlessly.

You might find it helpful to think of yourself and your group members as
composers of orchestral music and the four Ps as wind, string, percussion, and
brass instruments. Similar to how orchestral writers produce scores that unify
these instruments, your task is to produce an action plan that unifies the four
Ps. Orchestral writers produce music that a sequence of solos would fall far
short of. As a result, symphonies are greater than the sum of their parts.
Analogously, you should strive to combine elements of the marketing mix
synergistically. As a result, your action plan will be greater than the sum of
the four Ps.

The best action plans are also *concrete*. What does this mean practically? You
should not leave statements like "we think the line of Allianz products that we
are proposing should enter the market at a high price" undefined. What is a
*high* price? In this case, you need to assign dollar values to the individual
products that you think should be launched, using cogent reasoning, in order for
your action plan to carry weight. No matter the marketing-mix variable, try to
bring your recommendations to life by pushing your analysis beyond the abstract.
The action plan you develop should unambiguously describe what your initiative
would look like in the market and get as close to reality as possible.

Come to class having individually written at least a page of *new* ideas for
your group's action plan. Strive to describe how Allianz should implement your
recommendation, and how you arrived at these implementation choices, both
seamlessly and concretely. In class, your group will be given time to share your
ideas with one another, offer constructive feedback, and make progress on your
IIP 3 Client Standalone Deck Report.
