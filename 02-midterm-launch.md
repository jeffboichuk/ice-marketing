## Assignments Made {-}

- Discuss your analysis of the J.C. Penney case before our next session of
marketing. As you prepare for and engage in your group discussion, you might
find it helpful to consider the following guidelines that
[Haywood-Farmer][haywood-farmer-2008] [-@haywood-farmer-2008] suggests adhering
to:
    + Develop a thorough understanding of the case prior to your group meeting  
    + Participate actively in the discussion and take your own notes (consensus
    is neither necessary, nor expected)
    + Set a time limit, say 30 minutes, for your discussion and stick to it
