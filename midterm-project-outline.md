# (PART) Midterm {-}

# Midterm Project Outline {-}

## Overview and Objectives {-}

### Overview {-}
The primary goal of this midterm project is to give you an opportunity to apply
the skills you are learning in Marketing to a real-life situation, such that
you end up turning consumer/customer data that you collect and will be given
into [significant, actionable, interesting, novel, and broad insights][Colquitt
and George 2011] for [The Juice Laundry][tjl] (TJL), a local Charlottesville
business that is partnering with us for the purposes of this midterm report.

The more you engage in the marketing process that this report requires of you,
the better you will become at generating, disseminating, and responding to
market intelligence [@kohli-jaworski-1990]. Improving your ability to perform
these three core activities will in turn allow you to help
companies&mdash;especially those you want to work for&mdash;achieve a market
orientation and optimize collective value. After all, optimizing collective
value (i.e., prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a
result, marketing in the first place [@donaldson-walsh-2015].

### Company Overview {-}
As a brief summary, TJL is an organic juice and smoothie bar with three
locations, two in Charlottesville, VA, and one in Washington, DC. Founded by UVa
alumni Mike and Sarah Keenan, TJL's mission is "to inspire healthy, organic,
powerful change." In-store signage articulates Mike and Sarah's value
proposition to customers as follows:

> The Juice Laundry was founded on the concept of keeping our bodies clean and
healthy, starting with what we put into them. Raw, organic fruits and veggies
are nature's medicine and the foundation of preventative health care. Whether
juiced, blended, or eaten whole, fresh produce is full of life-giving nutrients
and enzymes. We choose to use 100% organic ingredients, 100% of the time,
because the phrase 'organic whenever possible' is often highly misleading. If we
can't find something organic on a given day, it won't be on our menu. That's our
commitment to you, and to your health.

Elsewhere in TJL's locations, the brand's slogan "Clean Your Machine" is
displayed prominently, as are the brand's defining principles: "We are Raw. We
are Fresh. We are Clean. We are Organic. We are Curious. We are Passionate. We
are Transparent. We Leave a Gentle Footprint." Missing in stores, however, are
trash cans, as 100% of TJL's packaging is either compostable or reusable.

For this midterm, Mike and Sarah are offering us "[a lab of sorts][]"
[@newman-2019], somewhere you can talk with them as well as TJL's employees and
customers; analyze data; develop and test ideas; and, eventually, see the impact
of your hard work right in our backyard on the Corner.

### Objectives
Your objectives are threefold: (1) identify an area of TJL's business that is
worth looking into; (2) evaluate three alternative directions that TJL could go
in in this respect; and (3) develop a comprehensive and convincing action plan
that logically flows from what you learn.

#### Topic Identification
In line with [@colquitt-and-george-2011], you should strive to identify and
address a topic that:

* __Takes on a grand challenge__ (i.e., has a compelling raison d'Ãªtre)
   + By aiming to solve a piece of a larger societal puzzle and, thus, having a
   compelling purpose (e.g., encouraging healthier eating habits, making
   commerce more sustainable).
* __Changes the conversation__
   + By exploring the potential of a bold idea that could lead TJL in an
   unfamiliar, nascent, and radically different direction.
* __Catches and holds Mike and Sarah's attention__
   + By challenging their taken-for-granted assumptions and solving a mystery
   you uncover that has multiple plausible endings and cannot be guessed.
* __Casts a wide net__
   + By covering the landscape of your topic adequately and, thus, considering a
   multitude of outcome variables (including potential unintended consequences),
   boundary conditions, and explanations.
* __Offers insights for practice__
   + By estimating the potential effect of a new and important practice and
   conveying findings that Mike and Sarah will be able to act on in the near
   term.

As is reflected in [this document][topic choice decision matrix template], Mike
and Sarah are interested in topics that focus on grand challenges, promise to
offer actionable insights, and peak their curiosity. With these priorities in
mind, you should be positoned to engage in the marketing process and help TJL
further achieve a market orientation.

While developing a list of potential topics to focus on, I encourage you to be
[divergent][peng-2018] in your thinking [@peng-2018]. Begin by conducting
extensive research on [Elevate], [Euromonitor], [Factiva], [Google Trends],
[Instagram], [Yelp], etc. This research, which can also occur in TJL's and its
competitors' storefronts, will guide you to challenges that TJL is facing (e.g.,
some consumers perceive that TJL offers low [value][zeithaml-1988]
[@zeithaml-1988]) as well as promising alternatives that TJL could consider
implementing to address these challenges (e.g., launching an Instagram campaign
focused on educating their followers about the true cost of food).

   __Pro tip__: Be [radically open minded][gallo-2017]&mdash;and [productively
   stupid][schwartz-2008] [@schwartz-2008]&mdash;during this first step and
   strive not to let confirmation bias contaminate your findings as you make
   sense of the market [@gallo-2017].

   __Pro tip__: Organize your observations into datasets, such as those
   discussed in [Chapter 12][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 12] of R for Data
   Science so you can summarize them statistically and visually. This process
   will add rigor to your analysis and the insights you generate.

Sort the challenges stemming from your research into buckets of alternatives.
Then, use the prioritization framework that [@colquitt-george-2011] offer to
select the three buckets (i.e., "topics" or "challenges") that you believe are
most worth looking into and highlight these topics in a [topic choice decision
matrix][topic choice decision matrix template]. From here, you will arrive at
the topic that you believe is most worth doing further research and reporting on
for your midterm report and presentation.

   __Pro tip__: Explain your topics clearly, so that decision makers will be
   able to fully appreciate: (a) the challenges your topics are focused on
   overcoming and (b) the alternatives your research has led you to consider.

#### Alternative Evaluation
Focused on the topic you identify, your next objective is to, in a concise and
well-balanced manner, explain three fundamentally different strategic directions
that TJL could go in. Further, you should arrive at and implement a set of
criteria that you believe Mike and Sarah should use to make decisions of this
sort.

By bringing these two components (alternatives and criteria) together, you will
complete a [value model][johnson-2018] for decision-making purposes
[@johnson-2018]. You might find it helpful to structure your value model using
[this template][value model template]. Overall, the goal is to evaluate a set of
well-balanced alternatives with a ranked set of relevant decision criteria in
order to propose a course of action in a convincing manner.

On this point, you should strive to explain your alternatives clearly and define
your criteria well, so that the scores you assign to the alternatives in your
value model will seem logical. In other words, try to increase the chances that
separate people (namely, your group, peers, me, Mike, and Sarah) will more or
less agree on the scores you assign to given alternative-criterion pairs and,
thus, the logic underlying your strategic recommendation by explaining your
alternatives clearly and defining your criteria cogently.

The datasets we will cover in class to help you support your decision making
with [data-informed insights][Parker 2017/06/06] include:

* The [juicelaundry][] R data package, which has point-of-sale transaction
details for all of TJL's locations from October 11, 2016 to December 31, 2018.
* [Google Trends][] data, which can capture relative search interest and
emerging trends for topics relevant to TJL's business.

While analyzing and communicating insights about these and other datasets, the
key is to describe the [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] of your data
parsimoniously and to define the variables you are analyzing to make decisions
[clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].

#### Action Plan
Having made your decision, your final objective is to develop an action plan
covering all relevant elements of the marketing mix in detail (i.e., product,
price, promotion, and place). Clients need to understand what has to be done
(i.e., by who, when, what, where, why, and how?) before they can accept your
claims and even begin to consider implementing your recommendations. In order to
set expectations, strive to establish goals related to consumers' attitudes,
emotions, and/or actions as well as to TJL's triple bottom line (i.e., profits,
people, and the planet) in [specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound][Miller 2018] ways.

## Deliverables
There are three key deliverables for the midterm:

1. A proposal of no more than 25 pages, using the stylistic requirements
outlined in the _Journal of Marketing Research_ Style Guide for formatting
purposes (see [here][jmr 1] and [here][jmr 2] for details). I will use the
[proposal guidelines](#proposal-guidelines) below to assess your proposal and
give you developmental feedback. Submit your proposal via GitHub no later than
March 28 at 11:59 pm.

2. A report of no more than 25 pages, using the stylistic requirements outlined
in the _Journal of Marketing Research_ Style Guide for formatting purposes (see
[here][jmr 1] and [here][jmr 2] for details). I will use the [report
guidelines](#report-guidelines) below to assess your report and give you
developmental feedback. Submit your report via GitHub no later than April 25 at
12:30 pm.

3. A presentation of no more than 12 minutes, plus up to eight minutes of Q&A.
An agenda will guide when groups present. Make sure your final presentation
title gets added to this agenda by submitting it no later than April 18 at 12:30
pm. Invited guests, your peers, and I will use the [presentation
guidelines](#presentation-guidelines) below to assess your presentation and give
you developmental feedback. Submit your slide deck via GitHub no later than
April 25 at 12:30 pm.

## Proposal Guidelines
Your proposal should outline your plan for this group project and describe in
detail:

1. The topic that you plan to focus on and the process you engaged in to find
it.
2. The data (i.e., datasets, rows, and columns) that you plan to analyze.
3. The visualizations and models that you plan to create and estimate in order
to turn the data you plan to analyze into market intelligence.
4. The processes and procedures that you have developed as a group to ensure
that your work is [collaborative, accurate, and reproducible][Parker 2017].

There is no one "right" way to organize this proposal; however, you should make
sure to outline what you plan to do&mdash;over the four weeks between the date
this proposal is due and the date you present to Mike and Sarah&mdash;very
carefully. I want to see evidence that you have thought critically, and in a
divergent manner, about TJL's business. What should TJL's top research priority
be, and why? What makes this topic significant, actionable, and interesting?
These are but two of the questions that your proposal should address to touch on
the first point above. The topic you plan to focus on should excite you, and
this section of the proposal is your opportunity to show that excitement.

Regarding the second point, I want to see that you have more than a
surface-level understanding of the [juicelaundry point-of-sale
data][juicelaundry] and [Google Trends data][Google Trends], both of which
you are being trained to analyze. At a minimum, you should highlight some
`filter()` and `mutate()` statements that will get these datasets into the forms
you need them in. In a best-case scenario, you will not only advance a detailed
proposal about how you plan to utilize these datasets fully, but also propose to
supplement the scope of your analyses with additional secondary datasets (think
weather data, for example). It will also be exemplary if you propose to reach
data-informed decisions about your chosen topic by way of creating
new-to-the-world tidy datasets. You could supplement the `menu_item` and `sku`
datasets in the juicelaundry package with comparable datasets for a competitor,
such as Corner Juice, for example, if doing so would aid your decision making.

For the third point, some questions I want to see you convey answers to include:
how do you plan on analyzing these datasets (i.e., with what methods?), and what
artifacts (e.g., graphics and model estimates) do you plan on producing? For the
fourth, be specific about the systems that your group has agreed to implement to
increase the chances that you will develop analyses for this project in a
[collaborative, accurate, and reproducible][Parker 2017] manner.

On April 1, I will meet with each team for 30 minutes between the times of 11:00
am and 2:30 pm in RRH 203. The purpose of these meetings will be to discuss your
progress and help you create significant momentum going into the final month of
the semester.

## Report Guidelines

Your report should advocate for strategic change to TJL's marketing mix. Base
your action plan on the shoulders of (i) a topic with an impressive
[anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011]; (ii) a decision-making process with strong
[principles][Dalio 2017]; (iii) data that are described [clearly, completely,
and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012]; (iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that
are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017]; and
(v) [stylish writing][Sword 2012].

There is no one "right" way to organize this report; however, you should think
carefully about what your audience (in this case, Mike and Sarah Keenan) already
knows and prioritize discussing original analysis that you have conducted over
general statements about TJL's business, for example. After reading your report,
I will use the following guidelines to assess your work and provide you with
developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you develop a
report worthy of an exemplary grade.

### Decision-Making Principles (20%)
* Cogent reasoning explains why the major decision being considered has an
impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011].
* The long-term, detrimental implications of inaction for The Juice Laundry are
argued concretely.
* Alternative courses of action are identified in a balanced, convincing manner.
* Decision criteria relevant to the major decision at hand are defined and
ranked cogently.
* The proposed course of action is very well reasoned, because said decision
criteria are used to evaluate the alternatives rigorously.

### Data (20%)
* The [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] and definitions of the data and
variables being analyzed to make decisions are described [clearly, completely,
and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].
* Convincing reasons explain why certain data are given priority over others
(e.g., red herrings).
* Statements about data limitations are made at appropriate times.

### Method (20%)
* A breadth and depth of techniques covered in [R for Data Science][Grolemund
and Wickham 2017] are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and
reproducibly][Parker 2017].
* A knowledgeable individual could [reproduce][Peng 2011] the report's findings
with ease, because the group's GitHub repository provides access to not only the
report, but also self-contained, executable code and the data being analyzed.
* Visualizations are used in ways that force the reader to notice [unexpected
phenomena][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 3.3].
* Hoofbeats are interpreted as signs of horses not [zebras][Sotos 2006].  
* Statements about methodological limitations are made at appropriate times.

### Action Plan (20%)
* All relevant elements of the marketing mix are covered in detail.  
* What needs to be done (i.e., who, when, what, where, why, and how) is
discussed expansively.
* The overall recommendation being proposed is creative (i.e., novel and
useful).
* Goals related to consumers' attitudes, emotions, and/or actions as well as to
TJL's triple bottom line (i.e., profits, people, and the planet) are set in
[specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound][Miller 2018] ways
in order to establish expected results.

### Style \& Grammar (20%)
* The expectations that Prof. Patterson set in Communication&mdash;which
include, but are not limited to, BLUF writing, SAS headings/tables/figures, and
SEC plain English&mdash;are met or exceeded at all times.
* Tables and figures are all formatted properly and [effectively][Grolemund and
Wickham 2017, 28.1].
* Every sentence is grammatically correct, and all sentences flow together
naturally.
* The report is free of spelling errors.  
* The *Journal of Marketing Research* Style Guide is adhered to at
all times (see [here][jmr 1] and [here][jmr 2] for details).
* The [Tidyverse Style Guide][] is adhered to at all times in the report's
[files][style files], [syntax][style syntax], and [pipes][style pipes].

## Presentation Guidelines
Prepare a two-minute presentation as you would if you were looking to secure a
meeting with a business leader in "the real world" with the goal of persuading
them to consider hearing more about an action plan you think they should pursue.
Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment you can, and do your best to
receive their approval. Up to a minute of Q&A will follow your presentation.

After listening to your presentation, your peers and I will use the following
guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. Internalizing these
guidelines will help you deliver a presentation worthy of an exemplary in-class
participation grade for `r filter(class_session, topic == "Midterm
Presentations") %>% pull(date)`.

* The presenter discussed the data they analyzed in a "simple, easy-to-understand
way" [@allen-2017].
* The presenter built a case for the action plan they proposed with
well-principled analyses that motivated me to accept their claims.
* The presenter was captivating, edutaining, and eye-catching, a "[fusion of
scientific rigor with canny attention-grabbing][Allen 2017]" [@allen-2017].
* The presenter responded to questions and reservations appropriately [see @jolles-2013].
* The presenter's slides were [self-explanatory][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 28.1],
well referenced, and free of errors.
