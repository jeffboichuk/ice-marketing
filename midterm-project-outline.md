# The Juice Laundry {-}

## Overview and Objectives {-}

### Project Overview {-}
The primary goal of this midterm project is to give you an opportunity to apply
the skills you are learning in Marketing to a real-life situation, such that you
end up turning consumer/customer data that you collect and that you will be
given into [significant, actionable, interesting, novel, and broad
insights][Colquitt and George 2011] for [The Juice Laundry][tjl] (TJL), a local
Charlottesville business that is partnering with us for the purposes of this
midterm project.

The more you engage in the marketing process that this project will require of
you, the better you will become at generating, disseminating, and responding to
market intelligence [@kohli-jaworski-1990]. Improving your ability to perform
these three core activities will in turn allow you to help
companies&mdash;especially those you want to work for&mdash;achieve a market
orientation and optimize the triple bottom line for profits, people, and the
planet [@elkington-2018]. After all, optimizing collective value (i.e.,
prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a result,
marketing in the first place [@donaldson-walsh-2015].

### Company Overview {-}
In brief, TJL is an organic juice and smoothie bar with five
locations, three in Charlottesville, VA, one in Richmond, VA, and one in
Washington, DC. Founded by UVA alumni Mike and Sarah Keenan, TJL's mission is
"to inspire healthy, organic, powerful change." In-store signage articulates
Mike and Sarah's [value proposition][] to customers as follows:

> The Juice Laundry was founded on the concept of keeping our bodies clean and
healthy, starting with what we put into them. Raw, organic fruits and veggies
are nature's medicine and the foundation of preventative health care. Whether
juiced, blended, or eaten whole, fresh produce is full of life-giving nutrients
and enzymes. We choose to use 100% organic ingredients, 100% of the time,
because the phrase 'organic whenever possible' is often highly misleading. If we
can't find something organic on a given day, it won't be on our menu. That's our
commitment to you, and to your health.

Elsewhere in TJL's locations, the brand's [slogan][] "Clean Your Machine" is
displayed prominently, as are the brand's [defining principles][]: "We are Raw.
We are Fresh. We are Clean. We are Organic. We are Curious. We are Passionate.
We are Transparent. We Leave a Gentle Footprint." Missing in stores, however,
are trash cans, as 100% of TJL's packaging is either [compostable][] or
reusable.

For this midterm, Mike and Sarah are offering us "[a lab of sorts][]"
[@newman-2019], somewhere you can talk with them as well as TJL's employees and
customers; analyze data; and, eventually, see the impact of your hard work right
in our backyard [at the AFC][] and [on the Corner][].

### Objectives {-}
Your objectives for this midterm project are threefold: (1) identify an area of
TJL's business that is worth looking into; (2) evaluate three alternative
directions that TJL could go in in this respect; and (3) develop a comprehensive
and convincing action plan that logically flows from what you learn.

#### Topic Identification {-}
How should you go about identifying an area of TJL's business that is worth
looking into? In line with @colquitt-george-2011, you should strive to identify
and address an area of inquiry that:

* __Takes on a grand challenge__ (i.e., has a compelling raison d'Ãªtre)
    + By aiming to solve a piece of a larger societal puzzle and, thus, having a
    compelling purpose (e.g., encouraging healthier eating habits, making
    commerce more sustainable).
* __Changes the conversation__
    + By exploring the potential of a bold idea that could lead TJL in an
    unfamiliar, nascent, and radically different direction.
* __Catches and holds Mike and Sarah's attention__
    + By challenging their taken-for-granted assumptions and solving a mystery
    you uncover that has multiple plausible endings and cannot be guessed.
* __Casts a wide net__
    + By covering the landscape of your topic adequately and, thus, considering
    a multitude of outcome variables (including potential unintended
    consequences), boundary conditions, and explanations.
* __Offers insights for practice__
    + By estimating the potential effect of a new and important practice and
    conveying findings that Mike and Sarah will be able to act on in the near
    term.

As is reflected on page three of the [midterm report template][], Mike and Sarah
are primarily interested in topics that focus on grand challenges, promise to
offer actionable insights, and peak their curiosity. With these priorities in
mind, you should be well positioned to engage in the marketing process and help
TJL further achieve a market orientation.

As you develop a list of potential topics to focus on, try your best to be
[divergent][peng 2018] in your thinking [@peng-2018]. Begin by conducting
extensive research on [Business Source Complete][], [Elevate][],
[Euromonitor][], [Factiva][], [Google Trends][], [IBISWorld][], [Instagram][],
[Mergent Intellect][], [Yelp][], and other platforms. This research, which can
also occur in TJL's and its competitors' storefronts, will guide you to
challenges that TJL is facing [e.g., some consumers think TJL offers low
[value][zeithaml 1988]; @zeithaml-1988] as well as promising alternatives that
Mike and Sarah could consider implementing to address these challenges (e.g.,
launching an Instagram campaign focused on educating their followers about the
true cost of food).

* __Pro tip__: Be [radically open minded][gallo 2017]&mdash;and [productively
stupid][schwartz 2008] [@schwartz-2008]&mdash;as you search for challenges and
strive not to let confirmation bias contaminate your findings [@gallo-2017].  
* __Pro tip__: Organize your observations into datasets, such as those discussed
in [Chapter 12][r4ds 12] of R for Data Science so you can summarize them both
statistically and visually [@wickham-grolemund-2017]. This process will add
rigor to your analysis and the insights you generate.

Sort the alternatives you identify into buckets of the challenges they address.
Then, use Colquitt and George's [-@colquitt-george-2011] prioritization
framework to select three buckets (i.e., topics) that you believe are most worth
looking into and highlight these topics in a topic choice decision matrix (see
page 3 of the [midterm report template][]). From here, you will arrive at the
topic you believe is most worth doing further research and reporting on for your
midterm project.

* __Pro tip__: Explain your topics clearly so that Mike and Sarah will be able
to fully appreciate: (a) the challenges your topics are focused on overcoming
and (b) the alternatives your research has led you to consider.

#### Alternative Evaluation {-}
Focused on the topic you identify, your next objective is to, in a concise and
well-balanced manner, explain the three fundamentally different directions that
you believe TJL should consider going in (one of which can be the status quo at
TJL). Further, you should arrive at and implement a set of criteria that you
believe Mike and Sarah should use to make decisions of this sort.

With alternatives and criteria in hand, you will be able to complete a [value
model][johnson 2018] for decision-making purposes [@johnson-2018]. You might
find it helpful to structure your value model using the exhibit on page four of
the [midterm report template][]. Overall, your goal should be to evaluate a set
of well-balanced alternatives with a ranked set of relevant decision criteria in
order to propose a course of action in a convincing manner.

On this point, you should strive to explain your alternatives clearly and define
your criteria well so that the scores you assign to alternatives in your value
model will seem logical. In other words, try to increase the chances that
separate people (namely, your peers, Mike, Sarah, and I) will more or less agree
on the scores you assign to given alternative-criterion pairs and, thus, the
logic underlying your strategic recommendation by explaining your alternatives
clearly and defining/ranking your criteria cogently.

While analyzing and communicating insights about these and other datasets, the
key is to describe the [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] of your data
parsimoniously and to define the variables you are analyzing to make decisions
[clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012] [@zhang-shaw-2012].

#### Action Plan {-}
Having made your decision, your final objective is to develop an action plan
that covers relevant elements of the marketing mix (e.g., product, price,
promotion, and place) seamlessly and concretely. Completing this objective well
is important because clients need to understand what has to be done (i.e., by
who, when, what, where, why, and how?) before they can accept your claims and
even begin to consider implementing your recommendation. In order to set
expectations, strive to establish goals related to consumers' attitudes,
emotions, and/or actions as well as to TJL's triple bottom line [i.e., profits,
people, and the planet; @elkington-2018] in [specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant, and time-bound][Miller 2018] ways [@miller-2017].

## Deliverables {-}
There are two key deliverables for the midterm project, a two-page report and a
two-minute presentation.

### The Midterm Report {-}

#### Content {-}
The report is your opportunity to show Mike and Sarah Keenan that you have
thought critically, and in a divergent manner [@peng-2018], about their
business. What should TJL's top priority be, and why? What makes this topic
significant, actionable, and interesting? What alternative approaches should TJL
be considering in this area, and how should Mike and Sarah be going about
deciding among these alternatives? Ultimately, your report should advocate for
some sort of strategic change to TJL's marketing mix in a well-reasoned manner.

More granularly, you should base the action plan you advocate for in your report
on the shoulders of (i) a topic with an impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George
2011] [@colquitt-george-2011]; (ii) a decision-making process with strong
[principles][Dalio 2017] [@dalio-2017]; (iii) analysis that is described
[clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012] [@zhang-shaw-2012];
(iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that are applied [accurately,
collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017] [@parker-2017]; and (v) [stylish
writing][Sword 2012] [@sword-2012].

#### Structure {-}
Your report should contain the following sections: (1) title page, (2) main body
(see âContentâ above), (3) references, (4) exhibits, and, potentially, (5)
appendices. There is no one "right" way to organize the main body of your
report; however, you should think carefully about what your audience (i.e., Mike
and Sarah Keenan) already knows and prioritize discussing original analysis that
you have conducted over general statements about TJL's business.

#### Length {-}
The main body of your report should not exceed 1,000 words. There is no word
limit for your exhibits, works cited, and endnotes.

#### Format {-}
Use 1-inch margins and 12-point serif font throughout. The main body of your
report should use 1.5 spacing. Your works cited, exhibits, and endnotes should
be single spaced. Refer to the [Interdisciplinary Project Project Description][]
for additional details about formatting client-ready business documents.

#### Assessment {-}
I will use the [Case Report Rubric][] to assess your report, which is worth ten
percent of COMM 3020, and to give you developmental feedback.

#### Submission {-}
Your report is due on Wednesday, November 13 at 9:00 am. Submit your report via
BlackBoard [here][report submission link], and use the following naming
convention for the file you submit: âb#-last-first.pdfâ (e.g.,
âb5-azami-sean.pdfâ). If you collect data or conduct analyses to inform your
report, you should add this material to your submission via an electronic
supplement. Use the same naming convention for this file (e.g.,
âb#-last-first.xlsxâ). Your report and supplements should all make stand-alone
sense. Deviating from the simple instructions in this paragraph will earn you a
lower grade (â2 out of 100 possible points).

### The Midterm Presentation {-}

#### Content {-}
Prepare a two-minute presentation focused primarily on the action plan in your
report and less so on the process that led to it (i.e., topic identification and
alternative evaluation). The goal of your presentation is to persuade Mike and
Sarah to agree to at least hear more about the action plan you think they should
pursue during a (not necessarily hypothentical) follow-up meeting. Ask for the
highest realistic level of commitment you can (e.g., a follow-up meeting or a
commitment to consider/pursue your recommendation), and do your best to receive
Mike and Sarah's approval. Up to a minute of Q&A will follow your presentation.

#### Structure {-}
Your presentation should contain the following slides: (1) title slide, (2) main
presentation (see âContentâ above), and, possibly, (3) appendices. The agenda
available [here][midterm presentation agenda] will determine when you present.
Make sure your final presentation title gets added to the agenda no later than
`r class_session[[10, "date"]]` at 9:00 am. There is no one "right" way to
organize your slide deck; however, you should think carefully about what your
audience (i.e., Mike and Sarah Keenan) already knows and prioritize discussing
important details of your recommendation and how your research led you to it
over general statements about TJL's business.

#### Length {-}
Beyond the two-minute limit on your presentation and one-minute limit on your
Q&A period, strive to use less than 90 words in your slides and to limit your
presentation to no more than six slides, including your title slide. Adhering to
these additional limits will ensure that you and the visual aspects of your
slides take center stage.

#### Format {-}
Use PowerPoint or Keynote for your presentation. Dress business casual. Honor
your peers, and their work, with your full attention during their presentations.

#### Assessment {-}
After listening to your presentation, Mike, Sarah, your peers, and I will use
the following guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. I
will convert my assessment to a score out 100 that will contribute up to five
percent of your grade for COMM 3020. Internalizing these guidelines is the first
step to delivering a presentation that will be worthy of an exemplary grade.

* The presenter built a case for the action plan they proposed with
well-principled analyses that motivated me to accept their claims.
* The presenter discussed the data they analyzed in a "[simple,
easy-to-understand way][Allen 2017]" [@allen-2017].
* The presenter was captivating, edutaining, and eye-catching, a "[fusion of
scientific rigor with canny attention-grabbing][Allen 2017]" [@allen-2017].
* The presenter's slides were [self-explanatory][Grolemund and Wickham 2017,
28.1], well referenced, and free of errors.
* The presenter responded to questions and reservations appropriately [see
@jolles-2019].

#### Submission {-}
Submit your slide deck for your presentation to Blackboard [here][presentation
submission link] no later than `r class_session[[10, "date"]]` at 9:00 am. Use
the following naming convention for the file you submit: âb#-last-first.pptâ
(e.g., âb5-azami-sean.pptâ).
