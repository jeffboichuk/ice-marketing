- `r class_session[[6, "topic"]]`

## Objective {-}

- To discuss when and how companies can overcome consumers' lay theories about
product attributes (e.g., tasty = unhealthy)

## Readings {-}

- [Just: Positioned to Target Mainstream Tastes? (A)][harvard-coursepack]

- [Food Marketing][harvard-coursepack] [@gibson-cian-boichuk-2018]

## Discussion Questions {-}

1. Read the case and its technical note on food marketing quickly, keeping the
following lay theories that consumers tend to use as rules of thumb when they
make decisions about food in the back of your mind: **inexpensive = unhealthy**,
**healthy = not tasty**, and **sustainable = not tasty**
[@haws-reczek-sample-2017; @raghunathan-walker-naylor-hoyer-2006;
@van-doorn-verhoef-2011]. Given Just's mission to "develop better-tasting,
healthier, and more sustainable foods from plants, then distribute them
intensively across a wide variety of grocery and food retail stores at an
affordable price" [@yemen-boichuk-cian-2018-a, p. 2], these lay theories present
obstacles that need to be circumvented. Take ten minutes to free write about
them. That is, write without regard to grammar, sentence structure, or spelling,
and leave your response to this question unpolished after ten minutes is up. The
dual purpose of free writing as a style of writing is to (a) increase your
understanding of the topics and (b) get your ideas flowing.
2. Is Just Mayo radically better than other mayonnaise in terms of its
tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability? How does it fare
against market-share leaders on these product attributes? Answering these
questions will require you to collect data and, therefore, to go beyond the
information presented in the readings. Focus on one of the product attributes
in your response (your choice), get creative, and be resourceful.
3. Given your responses to Q1 and Q2, what trade-offs and realities should
Just's team be conscious of as they work to increase consumers' perceptions of
Just Mayo along the product attributes of tastiness, affordability, healthiness,
and sustainability. As [@porter-1996] describes, "a trade-off means that more of
one thing necessitates less of another" (p. 68). Exposing the trade-offs and
relative (dis)advantages that exist in a product category is the first step to
uncovering the unique competitive position that a company should strive for.
4. What does Just Mayo need to be for it to carve out real estate in consumers'
minds as the best tasting, most affordable, healthiest, and most sustainable
mayonnaise in the grocery store? In particular, focus on how Just could lay
claim to this ideal competitive position with additional changes to Just Mayo's
packaging. If your analysis suggests that this ideal competitive position is not
achievable, focus on making changes to Just Mayo's packaging that highlight
product attributes that Just *can* hang its hat on.
