find it helpful to consider the following guidelines that [Haywood-Farmer]
[haywood-farmer-2008] [-@haywood-farmer-2008] suggests adhering to:  
    + Develop a thorough understanding of the case prior to your group meeting  
    + Participate actively in the discussion and take your own notes (consensus
    is neither necessary, nor expected)
    + Set a time limit, say 30 minutes, for your discussion and stick to it
