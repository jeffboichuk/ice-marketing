# (PART) Group Presentation Outlines {-}

# Formula Complete Fitness {-}

The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for Marketing on
`r class_session[[7, "date"]]` will present plans designed to help [Formula
Complete Fitness][] reach the male UVA student population more effectively to
[Ann Dunn][about] (co-owner of Formula).

Formula is a treadmill studio that offers [group exercise classes][] to the
Charlottesville community from its location on the corner of Preston Avenue and
10th Street NW. At least four fifths of its clients are female, and Formula is
interested in increasing the number of male UVA students that make use of its
classes during the school year. Ann and her husband Jason (co-owner of Formula)
keep finding themselves pondering the following question:

> Is there an identifiable, substantial, and accessible segment
[@wedel-kamakura-2012] of the male UVA student population that Ann and Jason
could engage if only this segment came to know about the classes Formula offers,
or does Formula need to offer a new type of class or launch some kind of new
initiative to get male UVA students into the studio?

In an effort to help Formula increase its reach, sift through the UVA student
population for males who are likely to be susceptible to the group fitness
classes that Formula offers or are underserved/dissatisfied in some way that
Formula could address profitably with a new type of class or initiative. See
@yankelovich-meer-2006 for tips on how to do so, and be sure to convey how you
conducted your survey (that is, explain how you examined and recorded relevant
features of the UVA male student population so as to perform a meaningful
segmentation). In addition, beyond defining where your group's search led you
(i.e., your target market), determine how Formula should position itself to
appeal to your target market. These steps will serve as a strong foundation for
the plan you present to Ann, regarding how she can reach your chosen target
market more effectively.

Both groups should prepare as they would if they were working on a consulting
project for Formula in "the real world," with the goal of persuading Ann to
implement their plans. Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment
you can (e.g., agreement that Formula should implement your plan), and
try your best to receive her approval during the up to eight minutes of Q&A that
will follow your presentation.
