## Discussion Questions {-}
Skim through and watch the Snapple and Adobe competition materials (i.e., the
client briefs, pitch books, and presentations). Then choose one competition
(Snapple or Adobe) and answer the following questions in detail.

1. What data and research informed the UVA promo classâ€™ campaign strategy?  
2. What one or two high-level problems did the UVA promo class identify for the
client (i.e., Snapple or Adobe)?  
3. What solutions did the UVA promo class advocate for? In other words, what was
the overarching theme of the campaign they pitched?
4. Which of the UVA promo class' executions  (i.e., mock-ups) did you find to be
the most compelling? How did they leverage it to bring their campaign to life
seamlessly, concretely, and effectively?  
5. How did the UVA promo class assure the judges that their campaign would be
successful?  

After completing these questions, familiarize yourself with the Tinder client
brief. In class, you and a group of four or five students will develop ideas for
how you would approach the competition. Subsequently, we will review the
promotion class' national championship campaign as a class and answer the above
five questions for it.
