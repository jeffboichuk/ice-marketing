Suppose that [Greg Driscoll][] (Commerce ’04), Assistant Athletics Director for
Strategic Marketing and Fan Engagement, wants to know whether chalking increases
attendance for home games. Since Driscoll joined the Virginia athletics
department in the fall of 2011, he’s recorded whether or not his staff used
sidewalk chalk to promote home games. This internal database also includes
variables that indicate the date, sport, and attendance of the home games that
took place during this eight-year timeframe.

1. What are the independent and dependent variables that Driscoll is interested
in?
2. Suppose that Driscoll regressed attendance on his chalking variable and found
a positive, significant coefficient. What potentially threatens the validity of
this result, how should this finding be interpreted, and what additional
variable(s), if any, could Driscoll collect and control for to rule out some
alternative explanations?
3. If Driscoll wants to produce the market intelligence he’s looking to generate
effectively, how could he do so by adhering to the opinionated analysis
development process advocated by @parker-2017?
