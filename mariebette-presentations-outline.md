The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for this class
session will pitch campaign plan's for MarieBette's 2020 Black History Month
Instagram Campaign. 

Your campaign plan should feature 29 people (one for each day of February 2020,
which is a leap year) from the past or present who have shaped the United
States. A critical decision that MarieBette is considering this fall relates to
how national versus local the people that they feature in 2020 should be. Visit
[The Jefferson School Heritage Center][] and consult other
sources&mdash;available on Grounds, online or via the UVA library&mdash;to learn
more about the history of race relations in Charlottesville. With a better
understanding of national and local figures that MarieBette could feature,
evaluate the relative merit of campaigns that would have a predominantly
national focus, local focus, and equal focus on national and local figures.
Build on your decision by developing an in-depth campaign plan for MarieBette
and establishing goals for the campaign. If you believe that your campaign will perform better than the campaign performed in 2019, provide reasoning for your expectation.
