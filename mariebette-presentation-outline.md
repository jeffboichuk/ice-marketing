# MarieBette {-}

The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for Marketing on
`r class_session[[13, "date"]]` will pitch plans to [Jason Becton][about]
(co-owner of MarieBette) for MarieBette's 2020 Black History Month Instagram
Campaign. The campaign you develop should feature 29 people (one for each day of
February 2020, which is a leap year) from the past or present who have shaped
the United States and/or Charlottesville. Build out a Google Sheet like [this
one][] to bring your plan to life.

A critical decision that Jason and his husband Patrick (co-owner of MarieBette)
are considering relates to how national versus local the people that MarieBette
features in 2020 should be. Visit [The Jefferson School African American
Heritage Center][], read about the [Memorial to Enslaved Laborers at UVA][]
[@bromley-2019], visit the [Catherine “Kitty” Foster site][] just south of Rouss
& Robertson Halls, and consult other sources&mdash;available on Grounds, online,
or via the UVA library&mdash;to learn more about the history of race relations
both nationally and in Charlottesville. With an in-depth understanding of
national and local figures that MarieBette could feature, evaluate the relative
merit of campaigns that would have a predominantly national focus, local focus,
and equal focus on national and local figures. After arriving at a decision,
develop an in-depth campaign plan for MarieBette and establish goals for the
campaign. Especially if you believe that your campaign will perform better than
the campaign performed in 2019 (see
[here][2019-mariebette-black-history-month-instagram-campaign]), offer cogent
reasoning to support your expectation.

Both groups should prepare as they would if they were working on a consulting
project for MarieBette in "the real world," with the goal of persuading Jason to
use their campaign plans. Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment you
can (e.g., agreement that MarieBette should implement your campaign plan) and
try your best to receive his approval during the up to eight minutes of Q&A that
will follow your presentation.
