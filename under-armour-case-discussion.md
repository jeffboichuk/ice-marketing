## Discussion Questions {-}

1. Spend four hours or less writing a case report for the 2017 final exam. What
components of your case report came easiest/hardest to you? Was it collecting
data that might be relevant to making a decision; identifying and stating one or
two high-level concerns, problems, or issues; identifying and evaluating
alternatives; or designing an action plan? Take ten minutes to free write about
the process you engaged in. (You can keep the case report you generate for your
own records.)
2. How could you further hone your decision-making and written communication
skills between now and the final exam period to help you reach your full
potential? Refer to page 3 of @haywood-farmer-2008 for ideas.
