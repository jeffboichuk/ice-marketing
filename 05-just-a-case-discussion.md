## Objective {-}

## Discussion Questions {-}

1. Read the case and its technical note on food marketing quickly, keeping the
following lay theories that consumers tend to use as rules of thumb when they
make decisions about food in the back of your mind: **inexpensive = unhealthy**,
**healthy = not tasty**, and **sustainable = not tasty**
[@haws-reczek-sample-2017; @raghunathan-walker-naylor-hoyer-2006;
@van-doorn-verhoef-2011]. Given JUST's mission to "develop better-tasting,
healthier, and more sustainable foods from plants, then distribute them
intensively across a wide variety of grocery and food retail stores at an
affordable price" [@yemen-boichuk-cian-2018-a, p. 2], these lay theories present
obstacles that need to be circumvented. Take ten minutes to free write about
them. That is, write without regard to grammar, sentence structure, or spelling,
and leave your response to this question unpolished after ten minutes is up.
This activity should increase your understanding of the topics and get your
ideas flowing.  
2. Is JUST Mayo radically better than other mayonnaise in terms of its
tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability? How does it fare
against market-share leaders on these product attributes? Answering these
questions will require you to collect data and, therefore, to go beyond the
information presented in the readings. Focus on **one** product attribute in
your response (the choice is yours), get creative, and be resourceful.  
3. Given your responses to Q1 and Q2, what trade-offs and realities should
JUST's team be conscious of as they work to increase consumers' perceptions of
JUST Mayo along the product attributes of tastiness, affordability, healthiness,
and sustainability. As [@porter-1996] describes, "a trade-off means that more of
one thing necessitates less of another" (p. 68). Exposing the trade-offs and
relative (dis)advantages that exist in a product category is the first step to
uncovering the unique competitive position that a company should strive for.  
4. What characteristics does JUST Mayo need to have for it to carve out real
estate in consumers' minds as the best tasting, most affordable, healthiest, and
most sustainable mayonnaise in the grocery store? In particular, focus on how
JUST could lay claim to this ideal competitive position by making additional
changes to JUST Mayo's packaging. If your analysis suggests that this ideal
competitive position is *not* achievable, focus on making changes to JUST Mayo's
packaging that will highlight product attributes that JUST *can* hang its hat
on.
