The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for this class
session will present arguments for or against the following statement:
   
   > Compared to online orders (e.g., Instacart, Prime Now, Walmart.com), retail
disruptors (e.g., Aldi, Lidl) represent a more significant threat to legacy
grocers (e.g., Kroger, HEB) in the United States over the next ten years.

[Bruce Montgomery][] will join us in class to hear these presentations. Both
groups should prepare their arguments as they would if they were presenting at a
conference attended by grocers (think Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, etc.) and
food and beverage companies (think PepsiCo, AB inBev, General Mills, etc.) in
"the real world," with the goal of persuading the audience that either retail
disruptors or online orders represent a more significant threat to legacy
grocers in the United States over the next ten years. Aim for the highest
realistic level of persuasion that you can (e.g., a majority of the audience's
support for your group's position in the debate), and try your best to receive
the audience's vote at the conclusion of the presentations. Both group
presentations will be followed by up to eight minutes of Q&A.
