To practice your presentation skills and receive feedback from Josh Tetrick, CEO of Just Readings Just: Positioned to Target Mainstream Tastes? (B) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018b) Discussion Questions A positioning statement captures a company’s intention for a product by expressing what the company hopes consumers will think of it. Using the following sentence structure, write a positioning statement for the chicken nuggets described in the case. Further, justify the decisions you made for the elements in square brackets. For [target market], [product name] will be the [differentiating factor(s)] compared to [competitive set] because [supporting evidence]. After considering the following paragraphs, develop a product, pricing, promotion, or placement strategy for the chicken nuggets described in the case. Quelch (1983) offers advice that has stood the test of time for how consumer product manufacturers can develop these strategies productively. Thus, reading Quelch (1983) and other related sources—such as those you can access in the archives of HBR—should help you work through this exercise. Product: Taking market factors into account, define a realistic set of specifications and/or thresholds for nutritional and sensory attributes that Just’s chicken nuggets need to have. What should Just name its chicken nuggets? What package size(s) and flavors should Just offer? How many stockkeeping units should the full portfolio of chicken nuggets have? What principles should guide Just’s package-design decisions for its chicken nuggets? Apply these principles to determine how Just should design its packaging. What should the packaging look like, and what materials should be used to make it? Are there certain labels or claims that Just should make sure to include on the packaging? Pricing: Which pricing strategy should Just adopt for its chicken nuggets: everyday low price (EDLP) pricing, high-low pricing, or a hybrid of the two? For each stockkeeping unit of chicken nuggets that you believe Just should bring to market, what should its manufacturer suggested retail price be? What temporary price reductions should Just offer to “encourage retailers and wholesalers to increase purchase commitments and build inventories” (Quelch 1983, p. 130), and for what package sizes should they offer these discounts? What pass-through rate should Just start negotiations at and strive to attain from retailers for the temporary price reductions they offer? When, how often, and for how long should Just offer temporary price reductions? Promotion: What advertising and social media activity should Just invest in to promote its chicken nuggets? What merchandising support (e.g., features in retailers’ weekly circulars, in-store displays) should Just aim to attain from retailers? In particular, be sure to set targets for the size, location, and timing of features and/or in-store displays. What slogan or message should Just use to promote its chicken nuggets? Placement: What retailers and regions of the United States should Just target for the launch of its chicken nuggets? Should Just plan to distribute its chicken nuggets intensively or selectively when they first hit the market? How much of Just’s focus should be on increasing market share in the retail and food-service sectors, respectively? Where in retail locations should Just aim to gain initial display space for its chicken nuggets? How many facings should Just aim to secure in a given grocery store? What restaurant types should Just target in the food-service sector: fast-food or full-service restaurants? Assignments Made Assignments Due References "],
