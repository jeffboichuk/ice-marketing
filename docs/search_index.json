I hope the material we cover will hone your ability to apply critical thinking skills to the managerial decisions that companies have asked marketers to make for decades. These decisions result in strategies that tend to fall into four buckets that comprise a company‚Äôs marketing mix. The first bucket pertains to product-related strategies. Here marketers answer questions like what shall we produce Conceptualizing marketing as the act of generating, disseminating, and responding to market intelligence will add structure to the discussions we have about how marketing can be practiced organization-wide to attain a market orientation and thereby optimize the triple bottom line for profits, people, and the planet. Business takes place in a multifarious landscape that involves, at one point or another, several or all of the following constituents: Participants involved in marketplace transactions, at one point or another, are multifarious: companies, competitors, consumers, channel intermediaries (agents, distributors, retailers, and wholesalers), governmental regulatory bodies, suppliers, The decisions that marketers inform and help companies make to influence these outcomes fall within the realm of the marketing mix (i.e., product, price, promotion, and place).

["wednesday-october-30.html", "Wednesday, October 30 Topic Objective Readings Discussion Questions Assignments Due Assignments Made", " Wednesday, October 30 Topic Just Case Discussion (A) Objective To discuss when and how companies can overcome consumers‚Äô lay theories about product attributes (e.g., tasty = unhealthy) Readings Just: Positioned to Target Mainstream Tastes? (A) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a) Food Marketing (Gibson, Cian, and Boichuk 2018) Discussion Questions Read the case and its technical note on food marketing quickly, keeping the following lay theories that consumers tend to use as rules of thumb when they make decisions about food in the back of your mind: inexpensive = unhealthy, healthy = not tasty, and sustainable = not tasty (Doorn and Verhoef 2011; Haws, Reczek, and Sample 2017; Raghunathan, Naylor, and Hoyer 2006). Given Just‚Äôs mission to ‚Äúdevelop better-tasting, healthier, and more sustainable foods from plants, then distribute them intensively across a wide variety of grocery and food retail stores at an affordable price‚Äù (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a, p. 2), these lay theories present obstacles that need to be circumvented. Take ten minutes to free write about them. That is, write without regard to grammar, sentence structure, or spelling, and leave your response to this question unpolished after ten minutes is up. The dual purpose of free writing as a style of writing is to (a) increase your understanding of the topics and (b) get your ideas flowing. Is Just Mayo radically better than other mayonnaise in terms of its tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability? How does it fare against market-share leaders on these product attributes? Answering these questions will require you to collect data and, therefore, to go beyond the information presented in the readings. Focus on one of the product attributes in your response (your choice), get creative, and be resourceful. Given your responses to Q1 and Q2, what trade-offs and realities should Just‚Äôs team be conscious of as they work to increase consumers‚Äô perceptions of Just Mayo along the product attributes of tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability. As (Porter 1996) describes, ‚Äúa trade-off means that more of one thing necessitates less of another‚Äù (p. 68). Exposing the trade-offs and relative (dis)advantages that exist in a product category is the first step to uncovering the unique competitive position that a company should strive for. What does Just Mayo need to be for it to carve out real estate in consumers‚Äô minds as the best tasting, most affordable, healthiest, and most sustainable mayonnaise in the grocery store? In particular, focus on how Just could lay claim to this ideal competitive position with additional changes to Just Mayo‚Äôs packaging. If your analysis suggests that this ideal competitive position is not achievable, focus on making changes to Just Mayo‚Äôs packaging that highlight product attributes that Just can hang its hat on.

(B) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018b) Discussion Questions A positioning statement captures a company‚Äôs intention for a product by expressing what the company hopes consumers will think of it.

After considering the following paragraphs, develop a product, pricing, promotion, or placement strategy for the chicken nuggets described in the case. Quelch (1983) offers advice that has stood the test of time for how consumer product manufacturers can develop these strategies productively. Thus, reading Quelch (1983) and other related sources‚Äîsuch as those you can access in the archives of HBR‚Äîshould help you work through this exercise. Product: Taking market factors into account, define a realistic set of specifications and/or thresholds for nutritional and sensory attributes that Just‚Äôs chicken nuggets need to have. What should Just name its chicken nuggets? What package size(s) and flavors should Just offer? How many stockkeeping units should the full portfolio of chicken nuggets have? What principles should guide Just‚Äôs package-design decisions for its chicken nuggets? Apply these principles to determine how Just should design its packaging. What should the packaging look like, and what materials should be used to make it? Are there certain labels or claims that Just should make sure to include on the packaging? Pricing: Which pricing strategy should Just adopt for its chicken nuggets: everyday low price (EDLP) pricing, high-low pricing, or a hybrid of the two? For each stockkeeping unit of chicken nuggets that you believe Just should bring to market, what should its manufacturer suggested retail price be? What temporary price reductions should Just offer to ‚Äúencourage retailers and wholesalers to increase purchase commitments and build inventories‚Äù (Quelch 1983, p. 130), and for what package sizes should they offer these discounts? What pass-through rate should Just start negotiations at and strive to attain from retailers for the temporary price reductions they offer?

What merchandising support (e.g., features in retailers‚Äô weekly circulars, in-store displays) should Just aim to attain from retailers?

Placement: What retailers and regions of the United States should Just target for the launch of its chicken nuggets? Should Just plan to distribute its chicken nuggets intensively or selectively when they first hit the market? How much of Just‚Äôs focus should be on increasing market share in the retail and food-service sectors, respectively?
