["wednesday-october-30.html", "Wednesday, October 30 Topic Objective Readings Discussion Questions Assignments Due Assignments Made", " Wednesday, October 30 Topic Just (A) Case Discussion Objective To discuss when and how companies can overcome consumers’ lay theories about product attributes (e.g., tasty = unhealthy) Readings Just: Positioned to Target Mainstream Tastes? (A) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a) Food Marketing (Gibson, Cian, and Boichuk 2018) Discussion Questions Read the case and its technical note on food marketing quickly, keeping the following lay theories that consumers tend to use as rules of thumb when they make decisions about food in the back of your mind: inexpensive = unhealthy, healthy = not tasty, and sustainable = not tasty (Doorn and Verhoef 2011; Haws, Reczek, and Sample 2017; Raghunathan, Naylor, and Hoyer 2006). Given JUST’s mission to “develop better-tasting, healthier, and more sustainable foods from plants, then distribute them intensively across a wide variety of grocery and food retail stores at an affordable price” (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a, p. 2), these lay theories present obstacles that need to be circumvented. Take ten minutes to free write about them. That is, write without regard to grammar, sentence structure, or spelling, and leave your response to this question unpolished after ten minutes is up. This activity should increase your understanding of the topics and get your ideas flowing. Is JUST Mayo radically better than other mayonnaise in terms of its tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability? How does it fare against market-share leaders on these product attributes? Answering these questions will require you to collect data and, therefore, to go beyond the information presented in the readings. Focus on one product attribute in your response (the choice is yours), get creative, and be resourceful. Given your responses to Q1 and Q2, what trade-offs and realities should JUST’s team be conscious of as they work to increase consumers’ perceptions of JUST Mayo along the product attributes of tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability. As (Porter 1996) describes, “a trade-off means that more of one thing necessitates less of another” (p. 68). Exposing the trade-offs and relative (dis)advantages that exist in a product category is the first step to uncovering the unique competitive position that a company should strive for. What characteristics does JUST Mayo need to have for it to carve out real estate in consumers’ minds as the best tasting, most affordable, healthiest, and most sustainable mayonnaise in the grocery store? In particular, focus on how JUST could lay claim to this ideal competitive position by making additional changes to JUST Mayo’s packaging. If your analysis suggests that this ideal competitive position is not achievable, focus on making changes to JUST Mayo’s packaging that will highlight product attributes that JUST can hang its hat on.

["thursday-november-7.html", "Thursday, November 7 Topic Objective Readings Discussion Question Assignments Due Assignments Made", " Thursday, November 7 Topic Midpoint Review and Margaritaville Project Working Session Objective To work on developing action plans for IIP 3 of the Margaritaville project that are seamless and concrete Readings Interdisciplinary Project Project Description Discussion Question How should Margaritaville implement your recommendation, and how did you arrive at these implementation choices? IIP 3 asks you to form a well-reasoned answer to this question that spans the four elements of the marketing mix. Rather than have separate paragraphs or sections for each of the four Ps, the action plan you advance in your IIP 3 Client Report should be seamless. As is true for inter-disciplinary curriculum in business schools, the best action plans are integrated. What does this mean practically? You should think of the marketing mix as a framework you can use to create a comprehensive action plan. However, it would be a mistake to let the framework silo your thinking or the structure of your output. Again, you should not separate your action plan into four paragraphs or sections, one for each element of the marketing mix. Instead, describe how M’ville should bring your initiative to market by weaving specifications for elements of the marketing mix into a holistic action plan seamlessly. You might find it helpful to think of yourself and your group members as composers of orchestral music and the four Ps as wind, string, percussion, and brass instruments. Similar to how orchestral writers produce scores that unify these instruments, your task is to produce an action plan that unifies the four Ps. Orchestral writers produce music that a sequence of solos would fall far short of. As a result, symphonies are greater than the sum of their parts. Analogously, you should strive to combine elements of the marketing mix synergistically. As a result, your action plan will be greater than a sum of the four Ps. The best action plans are also concrete. What does this mean practically? You should not leave statements like “we think the line of Margaritaville toasters that we are proposing should enter the market at a high price” undefined. What is a high price? In this case, you need to assign dollar values to the individual toasters that you think should be launched, using cogent reasoning, in order for your action plan to carry weight. No matter the marketing-mix variable, try to bring your recommendations to life by pushing your analysis beyond the abstract. The action plan you develop should unambiguously describe what your initiative would look like in the market and get as close to reality as possible. Come to class having individually written at least a page of new ideas for your group’s action plan. Strive to describe how Margaritaville should implement your recommendation, and how you arrived at these implementation choices, both seamlessly and concretely. In class, your group will be given time to share your ideas with one another, offer constructive feedback, and make progress on your IIP 3 Client Report.

["formula-complete-fitness.html", "Formula Complete Fitness", " Formula Complete Fitness The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for Marketing on Thursday, October 31 will present plans designed to help Formula Complete Fitness reach the male UVA student population more effectively to Ann Dunn (co-owner of Formula). Formula is a treadmill studio that offers group exercise classes to the Charlottesville community from its location on the corner of Preston Avenue and 10th Street NW. At least four fifths of its clients are female, and Formula is interested in increasing the number of male UVA students that make use of its classes during the school year. Ann and her husband Jason (co-owner of Formula) keep finding themselves pondering the following question: Is there an identifiable, substantial, and accessible segment (Wedel and Kamakura 2012) of the male UVA student population that Ann and Jason could engage if only this segment came to know about the classes Formula offers, or does Formula need to offer a new type of class or launch some kind of new initiative to get male UVA students into the studio? In an effort to help Formula increase its reach, sift through the UVA student population for males who are likely to be susceptible to the group fitness classes that Formula offers or are underserved/dissatisfied in some way that Formula could address profitably with a new type of class or initiative. See Yankelovich and Meer (2006) for tips on how to do so, and be sure to convey how you conducted your survey (that is, explain how you examined and recorded relevant features of the UVA male student population so as to perform a meaningful segmentation). In addition, beyond defining where your group’s search led you (i.e., your target market), determine how Formula should position itself to appeal to your target market. These steps will serve as a strong foundation for the plan you present to Ann, regarding how she can reach your chosen target market more effectively. Both groups should prepare as they would if they were working on a consulting project for Formula in “the real world,” with the goal of persuading Ann to implement their plans. Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment you can (e.g., agreement that Formula should implement your plan), and try your best to receive her approval during the up to eight minutes of Q&amp;A that will follow your presentation.

JUST Co-Founder and CEO Josh Tetrick will video conference into class for these presentations. Both groups should prepare as they would if they were working on a consulting project for Tetrick in “the real world,” with the goal of persuading him to pursue their action plans. Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment you can (e.g., agreement on the most important decisions you land on), and try your best to receive his approval during the up to eight minutes of Q&amp;A that will follow your presentation. The questions posed in the following paragraphs should help you begin to develop a seemless and concrete recommendation for bringing the chicken nuggets described in Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian (2018b) to market. The questions all stem from advice given in Quelch (1983), which has stood the test of time and (more than 35 years later) can still help food and beverage companies develop action plans for new products more productively. Thus, reading Quelch (1983) and other related sources—such as those you can access in the archives of HBR—should help you develop your presentation. Product: Taking market factors into account, define a realistic set of specifications and/or thresholds for nutritional and sensory attributes that JUST’s chicken nuggets need to have. What should JUST name its chicken nuggets? What package size(s) and flavors should JUST offer? How many stockkeeping units should the full portfolio of chicken nuggets have in it? What principles should guide JUST’s package-design decisions for its chicken nuggets? Apply these principles to determine how JUST should design its packaging. What should the packaging look like, and what materials should be used to make it? Are there certain labels or claims that JUST should make sure to include on the packaging?
