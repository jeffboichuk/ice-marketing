["index.html", "Marketing (Blocks 5 &amp; 6) Course Summary", " Marketing (Blocks 5 &amp; 6) Course Summary Welcome to the Marketing component of Fall ICE! This website includes an outline for your midterm project and a daily schedule for our class sessions. During our time together, we will focus on improving your ability to follow the marketing discipline’s first law: “Don’t sell what you happen to make; make what the consumer wants to buy” (Fennell 1978, p. 38). Our class sessions will hone your ability to apply critical thinking skills to the managerial decisions being asked of marketers in today’s information-based economy. Oftentimes these decisions pertain to how a company should go about designing its marketing mix, which is composed of the famous 4 Ps (product, price, promotion, and place). Conceptualizing marketing as the act of generating, disseminating, and responding to market intelligence (Kohli and Jaworski 1990) will allow us to discuss how marketing can be practiced organization-wide to help companies attain a market orientation and optimize their triple bottom lines for profits, people, and the planet (Elkington 2018). If asked the question “what is marketing?” during our first class session, you might define marketing similar to how you would define advertising. In contrast, by the time our last class session hits on Thursday, November 19, you should find that your view of marketing has broadened and deepened, no matter your starting point. I hope you will find the lessons we cover together to be valuable no matter your career interests (e.g., accounting, marketing, finance). Indeed, marketing is a shared responsibility and everyone in an organization needs to perform the role of marketing on a continuous basis, whether they “sit” in the marketing department or not. The reason being is that learning is at the core of the marketing process, so everything employees do to “embrace reality and deal with it” (Dalio 2017, p. 132) falls into the realm of marketing. I very much look forward to the time we will spend together. Please feel welcome to get in touch with me at any point if you have questions or a desire to talk about something we cover in detail. Sincerely, Prof. Boichuk References "],
["the-juice-laundry.html", "The Juice Laundry Overview and Objectives Expectations", " The Juice Laundry Overview and Objectives Project Overview The primary goal of this midterm project is to give you an opportunity to apply the skills you are learning in marketing to a real-life situation, such that you end up turning consumer/customer data that you collect into significant, actionable, and interesting insights for The Juice Laundry (TJL), a local Charlottesville business that is partnering with us for the purposes of this midterm project. The more you engage in the marketing process that this project will require of you, the better you will become at generating, disseminating, and responding to market intelligence (Kohli and Jaworski 1990). Improving your ability to perform these three core activities will in turn allow you to help companies—especially those you want to work for—achieve a market orientation and optimize the triple bottom line for profits, people, and the planet (Elkington 2018). After all, optimizing collective value (i.e., prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a result, marketing in the first place (Donaldson and Walsh 2015). Company Overview In brief, TJL is an organic juice and smoothie bar with three locations in Charlottesville, VA. Founded by UVA alumni Mike and Sarah Keenan, TJL’s mission is “to inspire healthy, organic, powerful change.” In-store signage articulates Mike and Sarah’s value proposition to customers as follows: The Juice Laundry was founded on the concept of keeping our bodies clean and healthy, starting with what we put into them. Raw, organic fruits and veggies are nature’s medicine and the foundation of preventative health care. Whether juiced, blended, or eaten whole, fresh produce is full of life-giving nutrients and enzymes. We choose to use 100% organic ingredients, 100% of the time, because the phrase ‘organic whenever possible’ is often highly misleading. If we can’t find something organic on a given day, it won’t be on our menu. That’s our commitment to you, and to your health. Elsewhere in TJL’s locations, the brand’s slogan “Clean Your Machine” is displayed prominently, as are the brand’s defining principles: “We are Raw. We are Fresh. We are Clean. We are Organic. We are Curious. We are Passionate. We are Transparent. We Leave a Gentle Footprint.” Missing in stores, however, are trash cans, as 100% of TJL’s packaging is either compostable or reusable. For this midterm, Mike and Sarah are offering us “a lab of sorts” (Newman 2019), somewhere you can talk with them as well as TJL’s employees and customers; analyze data; and, eventually, see the impact of your hard work right in our backyard at the AFC and on the Corner. Objectives Your objectives for this midterm project are threefold: (1) identify an area of TJL’s business that is worth looking into; (2) evaluate three alternative directions that TJL could go in in this respect; and (3) develop a comprehensive and convincing action plan that logically flows from what you learn. Topic Identification How should you go about identifying an area of TJL’s business that is worth looking into? In line with Colquitt and George (2011), you should strive to identify and address an area of inquiry that: Takes on a grand challenge (i.e., has a compelling raison d’être) By aiming to solve a piece of a larger societal puzzle and, thus, having a compelling purpose (e.g., encouraging healthier eating habits, making commerce more sustainable). Catches and holds Mike and Sarah’s attention By challenging their taken-for-granted assumptions and solving a mystery you uncover that has multiple plausible endings and cannot be guessed. Offers insights for practice By estimating the potential effect of a new and important practice and conveying findings that Mike and Sarah will be able to act on in the near term. As is reflected on page three of the midterm report template, Mike and Sarah are interested in topics that focus on grand challenges, offer actionable insights, and peak their curiosity. With these priorities in mind, you should be well positioned to engage in the marketing process and help TJL further achieve a market orientation. As you develop a list of potential topics to focus on, try your best to be divergent in your thinking (Peng 2018). Begin by conducting extensive research on Business Source Complete, Elevate, Euromonitor, Factiva, Google Trends, IBISWorld, Instagram, Mergent Intellect, Yelp, and other platforms (see the Commerce LibGuide for options). This research, which can also occur outside of TJL’s and its competitors’ storefronts at a safe physical distance from others, will guide you to challenges that TJL is facing (e.g., some consumers think TJL offers low value; Zeithaml 1988) as well as promising alternatives that Mike and Sarah could consider implementing to address these challenges (e.g., launching an Instagram campaign focused on educating their followers about the true cost of food). Pro tip: Be radically open minded—and productively stupid (Schwartz 2008)—as you search for challenges and strive not to let confirmation bias contaminate your findings (Gallo 2017). Pro tip: Organize your observations into datasets, such as those discussed in Chapter 12 of R for Data Science so you can summarize them both statistically and visually (Wickham and Grolemund 2017). This process will add rigor to your analysis and the insights you generate. Sort the alternatives you identify into buckets of the challenges they address. Then, use Colquitt and George’s (2011) prioritization framework to select three buckets (i.e., topics) that you believe are most worth looking into and highlight these topics in a topic choice decision matrix (see page 3 of the midterm report template). From here, you will arrive at the topic you believe is most worth doing further research and reporting on for your midterm project. Pro tip: Explain your topics clearly so that Mike and Sarah will be able to fully appreciate: (a) the challenges your topics are focused on overcoming and (b) the alternatives your research has led you to consider. Alternative Evaluation Focused on the topic you identify, your next objective is to, in a concise and well-balanced manner, explain the three fundamentally different directions that you believe TJL should consider going in (one of which can be related to improving the status quo at TJL). Further, you should arrive at and implement a set of criteria that you believe Mike and Sarah should use to make decisions of this sort. With alternatives and criteria in hand, you will be able to complete a value model for decision-making purposes (Johnson 2018). You might find it helpful to structure your value model using the exhibit on page four of the midterm report template. Overall, your goal should be to evaluate a set of well-balanced alternatives with a ranked set of relevant decision criteria in order to propose a course of action in a convincing manner. On this point, you should strive to explain your alternatives clearly and define your criteria well so that the scores you assign to alternatives in your value model will seem logical. In other words, try to increase the chances that separate people (namely, your peers, Mike, Sarah, and I) will more or less agree on the scores you assign to given alternative-criterion pairs and, thus, the logic underlying your strategic recommendation by explaining your alternatives clearly and defining/ranking your criteria cogently. While analyzing and communicating insights about these and other datasets, the key is to describe the provenance of your data parsimoniously and to define the variables you are analyzing to make decisions clearly, completely, and credibly (Zhang and Shaw 2012). Action Plan Having made your decision, your final objective is to develop an action plan that covers relevant elements of the marketing mix (e.g., product, price, promotion, and place) seamlessly and concretely. Completing this objective well is important because clients need to understand what has to be done (i.e., by who, when, what, where, why, and how?) before they can accept your claims and even begin to consider implementing your recommendation. In order to set expectations, strive to establish goals related to consumers’ attitudes, emotions, and/or actions as well as to TJL’s triple bottom line (i.e., profits, people, and the planet; Elkington 2018) in specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound ways (Miller 2017). Expectations Content This midterm report is your opportunity to show Mike and Sarah Keenan that you have thought critically, and in a divergent manner (Peng 2018), about their business. What should TJL’s top priority be, and why? What makes this topic significant, actionable, and interesting? What alternative approaches should TJL be considering in this area, and how should Mike and Sarah be going about deciding among these alternatives? Ultimately, your report should advocate for some sort of strategic change to TJL’s marketing mix in a well-reasoned manner. More granularly, you should base the action plan you advocate for in your report on the shoulders of (i) a topic with an impressive anatomy (Colquitt and George 2011); (ii) a decision-making process with strong principles (Dalio 2017); (iii) analysis that is described clearly, completely, and credibly (Zhang and Shaw 2012); (iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that are applied accurately and reproducibly (Parker 2017); and (v) stylish writing (Sword 2012). Structure Your report should contain the following sections: (1) title page, (2) main body (see “Content” above), (3) references, (4) exhibits, and, potentially, (5) appendices. There is no one “right” way to organize the main body of your report; however, you should think carefully about what your audience (i.e., Mike and Sarah Keenan) already knows and prioritize discussing original analysis that you have conducted over general statements about TJL’s business. Length The main body of your report should not exceed 1,000 words. There is no word limit for your exhibits, works cited, and endnotes. Format Use 1-inch margins and 12-point serif font throughout. The main body of your report should use 1.5 spacing. Your works cited, exhibits, and endnotes should be single spaced. Refer to the Interdisciplinary Project Project Description for additional details about formatting client-ready business documents. Assessment I will use the Case Report Rubric to assess your report, which is worth ten percent of COMM 3020, and to give you developmental feedback. Submission Your report is due on Tuesday, November 3 at 12:01 am. Submit your report via BlackBoard here, and use the following naming convention for the file you submit: “b#-last-first.docx” (e.g., “b5-hammond-austin.docx”). If you collect data or conduct analyses to inform your report, you should add this material to your submission via an electronic supplement. Use the same naming convention for this file (e.g., “b#-last-first.xlsx”). Your report and supplements should all make stand-alone sense. Deviating from the simple instructions in this paragraph will earn you a lower grade (–2 out of 100 possible points). References "],

["tuesday-october-20.html", "Tuesday, October 20 Classroom Topic Objective Readings Discussion Questions Assignments Due Assignments Made", " Tuesday, October 20 Classroom Blue (required) Topic Just (A) Case Discussion Objective To discuss when and how companies can overcome consumers’ lay theories about product attributes (e.g., tasty = unhealthy) Readings Just: Positioned to Target Mainstream Tastes? (A) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a) Food Marketing (Gibson, Cian, and Boichuk 2018) Discussion Questions Read the case and its technical note on food marketing quickly, keeping the following lay theories that consumers tend to use as rules of thumb when they make decisions about food in the back of your mind: inexpensive = unhealthy, healthy = not tasty, and sustainable = not tasty (Doorn and Verhoef 2011; Haws, Reczek, and Sample 2017; Raghunathan, Naylor, and Hoyer 2006). Given JUST’s mission to “develop better-tasting, healthier, and more sustainable foods from plants, then distribute them intensively across a wide variety of grocery and food retail stores at an affordable price” (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018a, p. 2), these lay theories present obstacles that need to be circumvented. Take ten minutes to free write about them. That is, write without regard to grammar, sentence structure, or spelling, and leave your response to this question unpolished after ten minutes is up. This activity should increase your understanding of the topics and get your ideas flowing. Is JUST Mayo radically better than other mayonnaise in terms of its tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability? How does it fare against market-share leaders on these product attributes? Answering these questions will require you to collect data and, therefore, to go beyond the information presented in the readings. Focus on one product attribute in your response (the choice is yours), get creative, and be resourceful. Given your responses to Q1 and Q2, what trade-offs and realities should JUST’s team be conscious of as they work to increase consumers’ perceptions of JUST Mayo along the product attributes of tastiness, affordability, healthiness, and sustainability. As (Porter 1996) describes, “a trade-off means that more of one thing necessitates less of another” (p. 68). Exposing the trade-offs and relative (dis)advantages that exist in a product category is the first step to uncovering the unique competitive position that a company should strive for. What characteristics does JUST Mayo need to have for it to carve out real estate in consumers’ minds as the best tasting, most affordable, healthiest, and most sustainable mayonnaise in the grocery store? In particular, focus on how JUST could lay claim to this ideal competitive position by making additional changes to JUST Mayo’s packaging. If your analysis suggests that this ideal competitive position is not achievable, focus on making changes to JUST Mayo’s packaging that will highlight product attributes that JUST can hang its hat on.

["tuesday-october-27.html", "Tuesday, October 27 Classroom Topic Objective Readings Discussion Question Assignments Due Assignments Made", " Tuesday, October 27 Classroom Orange (required) Topic Midpoint Review and Allianz Project Working Session Objective To work on developing action plans for IIP 2 of the Allianz project that are seamless and concrete Readings Interdisciplinary Project Project Description Discussion Question How should Allianz implement your recommendation, and how did you arrive at these implementation choices? IIP 2 asks you to form a well-reasoned answer to this question that spans the four elements of the marketing mix. Rather than have separate paragraphs or sections for each of the four Ps, the action plan you advance in your IIP 2 Client Report should be seamless. As is true for inter-disciplinary curriculum in business schools, the best action plans are integrated. What does this mean practically? You should think of the marketing mix as a framework you can use to create a comprehensive action plan. However, it would be a mistake to let the framework silo your thinking or the structure of your output. Again, you should not separate your action plan into four paragraphs or sections, one for each element of the marketing mix. Instead, describe how Allianz should bring your initiative to market by weaving specifications for elements of the marketing mix into a holistic action plan seamlessly. You might find it helpful to think of yourself and your group members as composers of orchestral music and the four Ps as wind, string, percussion, and brass instruments. Similar to how orchestral writers produce scores that unify these instruments, your task is to produce an action plan that unifies the four Ps. Orchestral writers produce music that a sequence of solos would fall far short of. As a result, symphonies are greater than the sum of their parts. Analogously, you should strive to combine elements of the marketing mix synergistically. As a result, your action plan will be greater than a sum of the four Ps. The best action plans are also concrete. What does this mean practically? You should not leave statements like “we think the line of Allianz products that we are proposing should enter the market at a high price” undefined. What is a high price? In this case, you need to assign dollar values to the individual products that you think should be launched, using cogent reasoning, in order for your action plan to carry weight. No matter the marketing-mix variable, try to bring your recommendations to life by pushing your analysis beyond the abstract. The action plan you develop should unambiguously describe what your initiative would look like in the market and get as close to reality as possible. Come to class having individually written at least a page of new ideas for your group’s action plan. Strive to describe how Allianz should implement your recommendation, and how you arrived at these implementation choices, both seamlessly and concretely. In class, your group will be given time to share your ideas with one another, offer constructive feedback, and make progress on your IIP 2 Client Stand-alone Deck Report.

(B) (Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian 2018b) Discussion Questions A positioning statement captures a company’s intention for a product by expressing what the company hopes consumers will think of it.

For [target market], JUST [product name] will be the [differentiating factor(s)] compared to [competitive set] because [supporting evidence]. How should JUST bring the chicken nuggets described in Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian (2018b) to market? JUST Co-Founder and CEO Josh Tetrick will video conference into class for this session. Prepare an answer to this question as you would if you were working on a consulting project for Tetrick in “the real world,” with the goal of persuading him to pursue your action plan. Ask for the highest realistic level of commitment you can (e.g., agreement on one or two of the most important decisions you land on) and try your best to receive his approval during class time. The questions posed in the following paragraphs should help you develop a seemless and concrete recommendation for bringing the chicken nuggets described in Yemen, Boichuk, and Cian (2018b) to market. You are neither expected to answer all of them, nor are you limited to them (much more has been written on the topic of making trade promotion more productive in the archives of HBR). But the questions stem from advice given in Quelch (1983) that has stood the test of time and (more than 35 years later) this advice continues to help food and beverage companies develop action plans for new products. Thus, addressing many of them, reading Quelch (1983), and referencing additional sources should help you develop an exemplary elevator pitch for Tetrick. Product: Taking market factors into account, define a realistic set of specifications and/or thresholds for nutritional and sensory attributes that JUST’s chicken nuggets need to have. What should JUST name its chicken nuggets? What package size(s) and flavors should JUST offer? How many stockkeeping units should the full portfolio of chicken nuggets have in it? What principles should guide JUST’s package-design decisions for its chicken nuggets? Apply these principles to determine how JUST should design its packaging. What should the packaging look like, and what materials should be used to make it? Are there certain labels or claims that JUST should make sure to include on the packaging? Pricing: Which pricing strategy should JUST adopt for its chicken nuggets: everyday low price (EDLP) pricing, high-low pricing, or a hybrid of the two? For each stockkeeping unit of chicken nuggets that you believe JUST should bring to market, what should its manufacturer suggested retail price be? What temporary price reductions should JUST offer to “encourage retailers and wholesalers to increase purchase commitments and build inventories” (Quelch 1983, p. 130)? For what package sizes should they offer these discounts? What pass-through rate should JUST start negotiations at and strive to attain from retailers for the temporary price reductions they offer? When, how often, and for how long should JUST offer temporary price reductions? Promotion: What advertising and social media activity should JUST invest in to promote its chicken nuggets? What merchandising support (e.g., features in retailers’ weekly circulars, in-store displays) should JUST aim to attain from retailers? In particular, be sure to set targets for the size, location, and timing of features and/or in-store displays. What slogan or message should JUST use to promote its chicken nuggets?
