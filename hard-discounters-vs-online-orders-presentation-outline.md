# Hard Discounters vs. Online Orders {-}

The two groups that choose to develop 12-minute presentations for Marketing on
`r class_session[[11, "date"]]` will be responsible for presenting arguments for
or against the following statement:

> Compared to online orders (e.g., via Instacart, Prime Now, Walmart.com),
hard discounters (e.g., Aldi, Lidl) represent a more significant threat to
legacy grocers (e.g., Kroger, HEB) in the United States over the next ten years.

[Bruce Montgomery][] will join us in class for these presentations. Both groups
should prepare their arguments as they would if they were presenting at a
conference attended by legacy grocers (think Kroger, Albertsons, Food Lion,
Publix etc.) and food and beverage companies (think PepsiCo, AB InBev, General
Mills, etc.) in "the real world," with the goal of persuading the audience that
either online orders or hard disruptors represent a more significant threat to
legacy grocers in the United States over the next ten years. Ask for the highest
realistic level of commitment that you can (e.g., a majority of the audience's
support for your group's position in the debate) and try your best to receive
the audience's vote at the conclusion of the presentations. Both group
presentations will be followed by up to eight minutes of Q&A.

Generating a thorough understanding of the (a) factors that weigh most heavily
on consumers' grocery shopping habits in the United States and (b) consumers'
gains and losses that come with shopping at hard discounters and placing orders
online versus shopping at legacy grocers should help you begin to develop a
convincing argument.
