## Discussion Questions {-}
[Formula Complete Fitness][] is a treadmill studio that offers [group exercise
classes][] to the Charlottesville community from its location on the corner of
Preston Avenue and 10 Street NW. At least 75 percent of its clients are female,
and Formula is interested in increasing the number of male UVA students that
make use of its classes. In an effort to help Formula increase its reach, sift
through the UVA student population for males that are likely to be susceptible
to the group fitness classes that Formula offers or are underserved/dissatisfied
in some way that Formula could address profitably.

1. How did you conduct your search and where did it lead you? In other words,
what are the most common demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal
characteristics of the students that your search turned up?
2. What qualities (e.g., product attributes) does a fitness class need to have
for the male students in your chosen target market to be receptive to it?
3. Develop a brief action plan that Formula could implement to reach your chosen
target market more effectively.
