# Course Summary {-}

Welcome to the marketing component of fall ICE! 

During our time together, we will focus and expand on the marketing discipline's
first law:

> “Don't sell what you happen to make; make what the consumer wants to buy”
[@fennell-1978, p. 38]. 

Our class sessions will hone your ability to apply critical thinking skills to
the managerial decisions being asked of marketers in today's information-based
economy. Oftentimes these decisions pertain to how a company should go about
designing its marketing mix, which is composed of the famous 4 Ps (product,
price, promotion, and place).

Conceptualizing marketing as the act of generating, disseminating, and
responding to market intelligence [@kohli-jaworski-1990] will help us discuss
how marketing can be practiced organization-wide to help companies attain a
market orientation and optimize their triple bottom lines for profits, people,
and the planet [@elkington-2018].

If you were to answer the question "what is marketing?" during our first class
session, it would be forgivable if you said that marketing and advertising are
one and the same. By contrast, when our time together comes to a close on 
`r class_session[[16, "date"]]`, you should find that your view of marketing has
broadened and deepened, no matter your starting point. Indeed, marketing is a
shared responsibility and everyone in an organization must perform the role of
marketing at one point or another, whether or not they "sit" in the marketing
department. You could even say that everything an employee does to "embrace
reality and deal with it" [@dalio-2017, p. 132] falls into the realm of
marketing.

This website includes outlines for the presentations your group can choose from,
an outline for the midterm project, and a daily schedule for our class sessions.
