# Course Summary {-}

Welcome to Marketing! This course is focused on the discipline's first law:

> “Don't sell what you happen to make; make what the consumer wants to buy”
[@fennell-1978, p. 38]. 

Structured according to 4 Ps (product, price, promotion, and place), our class
sessions will hone your ability to apply critical thinking skills to the
managerial decisions being asked of marketers in today's information-based
economy. Conceptualizing marketing as the act of generating, disseminating, and
responding to market intelligence [@kohli-jaworski-1990] will allow us to
discuss how marketing can be practiced organization-wide to attain a market
orientation and optimize the triple bottom line for profits, people, and the
planet [@elkington-2018].

This website includes the daily schedule for our class sessions, as well as
outlines for the presentations your group can choose from and the midterm
project.
