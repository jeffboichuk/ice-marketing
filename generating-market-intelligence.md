## Discussion Questions {-}

1. How have you personally gone about searching for people in their 30s and 40s
(i.e., born between 1960 and 1989) that are likely to be susceptible to the
Margaritaville brand or underserved / dissatisfied in some way that
Margaritaville could address profitably with a new initiative?
2. Where has your search and those of your group members led your group? In
other words, what are the most common demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal
characteristics of the people that your searches have turned up?
3. What qualities (e.g., product attributes) does your group's initiative need
to have for the people in your target market to be receptive to it?
4. What type of relationship do people tend to form with the product or service
that your group is proposing to launch? Draw on the *gravity of decision
spectrum* tool advanced by @yankelovich-meer-2006 for your answer.
