1. Spend four hours or less writing a case report on the decision outlined in
the 2019 final exam. (Be sure to keep the case report that you generate for your
own records. Doing so will allow you to look back at your ability level at this
point in the semester. Do not submit your report.)  
2. What components of your case report came easiest/hardest to you? Was it
collecting data that might be relevant to making a decision; identifying and
stating one or two high-level concerns, problems, or issues; identifying and
evaluating alternatives; or designing an action plan?

  - Develop a thorough understanding of the case prior to your group meeting  
  - Participate actively in the discussion and take your own notes (consensus is 
  neither necessary, nor expected)  
  - Set a time limit, say 30 minutes, for your discussion and stick to it
